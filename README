|
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Theory of Operation:
|     This is the main program run by the vehicles central Electronic Control Unit (ECU), a Teensy 4.1. 
|
|     It can be broken down into 6 States:
|       1. Init
|       2. Precharge
|       2. Wait_For_RTD
|       3. Idle
|       4. Drive
|       5. Brake (In Development)
|       6. Fault
|
|           Precharge is designed to first check for the activation of the tractive (High Voltage) 
|     system through the status of the shutdown circuit output to AIR- and the Precharge Relay. 
|     The shutdown circuit is a series of switches that, when closed, provide 12V to AIR coils. Once
|     high, the tractive system is active and the susbsequently precharging, at which point after 500ms
|     of charging the ECU biases AIR+ shut. At this point, the tractive system is fully energized and
|     ready to drive the motor, while the discharge relay becomes inverted with respect to the 
|     shutdown circuit signal. 
|
|           RTD Driver Input is designed to wait for a signal from the driver to put the vehicle into
|     it's drive state. Specifically, the driver must step on the brake pedal and then press the Ready
|     to drive button in the cockpit. 
|
|           The vehicle will remain in Idle once it is ready to drive and the operator is not requesting
|     acceleration. The long term goal of this state is to incorporate power saving features here
|
|           Drive will continually process pedal signals from the driver and broadcast the percent 
|     request over the CANBus to the motor controller. Drive executes important safety checks such as 
|     the accelerator pedal redundancy check. (**Still in development**)
|
|           Upon any non-zero percent request for braking, the vehicle will enter the brake state.
|     A CAN message will be sent to the Motor Controller to set its speed register to 0. In the future,
|     this state will incorporate regenerative braking. 
|
|           The vehicle will remain in the fault state until it is rekeyed. Error code CAN messages will
|     continue to be sent outside of the switch-case statement along with ...
|
|
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Inputs:
|           The ECU recieves inputs from the shutdown circuit tap, RTD button, accelerator pedal 1, 
|     accelerator pedal 2, and the brake pedal. These 5V and 12V (max) signals are fed through voltage  
|     dividers so that 3.3V is seen at the pins of the Teensy. 
|
|     ***We need to include the supply voltages to each pedal and process these via the GPIO pins on the
|     ECU PCB so that we can normalize the output signal voltages to their respective supply***
|   
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Processing:
|           The majority of data processing is done to the 3 analog pedal input signals. Analog pedal
|     data must be averaged, APPS1 and APPS2 must be compared for redundancy, and then the outputs are 
|     (averaged?) and scaled to 16 bits from the 10 bit size assigned to digital read inputs.
|
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Outputs:
|           The ECU outputs drive MOSFETS that control the AIR+, discharge relay, RTD sound, brake
|     light, RUN signal and GO signal. In addition, the ECU outputs CAN data to the CANBus, with an
|     optional 120Ohm terminating resistor on the PCB.

| Associated Rules:
|     - EV. 5.6   (Precharge)
|     - EV. 9.1   (Activation Sequence)
|     - EV. 9.4.2 (RTD Conditions)
|     - T. 4.2    (APPS)
